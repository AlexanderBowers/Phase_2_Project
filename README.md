~~Looking For Raid~~
by Riley Iverson
and Alexander Bowers

Welcome to looking for raid!
Here we have users, groups, raids, and roles

Users profile pages include links to their discord and steam accounts.

When you create a new group,
a user_group instance is created.

When you join a group with a role,
a user_group_role instance is created

Groups and Raids are joined with group_raids

Users who create a party are considered the party leader.
Party leaders can 'finalize' the group and drops will be added to users' inventories.

If you find a raid you want to choose doesn't exit, you can add it in!
